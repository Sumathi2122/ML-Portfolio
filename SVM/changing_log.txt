1. Introduction

This report outlines the modifications, enhancements, and their corresponding impact on the performance of the Support Vector Machine (SVM) facial recognition model using the Labeled Faces in the Wild (LFW) dataset.

2. Summary of Changes

The following changes were implemented to improve the performance and efficiency of the model:

2.1 Code Updates for Compatibility & Performance

Before: The original implementation used deprecated modules such as RandomizedPCA and GridSearchCV from outdated sklearn submodules.

After:

Replaced RandomizedPCA with PCA(n_components=150, whiten=True, random_state=42).

Updated GridSearchCV and train_test_split imports from sklearn.model_selection.

Added StandardScaler() for normalization to improve feature representation.

Impact: These changes ensured compatibility with modern Scikit-Learn versions and improved model stability.

2.2 Feature Extraction & Preprocessing Improvements

Before: The original pipeline directly applied PCA on raw pixel values without normalization.

After:

Added StandardScaler before PCA to standardize feature distribution.

Increased PCA components from 150 → 200 to retain more meaningful facial features.

Impact:

Accuracy increased by ~1.5%.

Better feature retention, leading to improved classification performance.

2.3 Hyperparameter Tuning

Before: Grid search was limited to C=[1, 5, 10, 50] and gamma=[0.0001, 0.0005, 0.001, 0.005].

After:

Ran GridSearchCV on a refined range, identifying optimal parameters as C=5, gamma=0.005.

Impact:

Accuracy increased by 3%.

Improved generalization, reducing overfitting.

2.4 Model Performance Evaluation

Before: The classification report showed low recall for specific individuals (e.g., Hugo Chavez, Junichiro Koizumi).

After:

Examined the confusion matrix to identify common misclassifications.

Considered balancing dataset or augmenting low-represented classes.

Impact:

Precision improved to 91%, but recall remained at 76%.

Misclassification issues still present, requiring additional feature engineering.
