Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
Dataset Used: Jena Climate Dataset

Task: Time series forecasting (temperature prediction)

Tools: TensorFlow/Keras, StandardScaler, Pandas

What We Did:
Downloaded and loaded multivariate climate data.

Visualized trends in temperature to understand periodicity.

Selected relevant features: temperature, pressure, humidity.

Normalized features using StandardScaler.

Created sliding-window sequences for time series modeling.

Built an LSTM model:

Single LSTM layer followed by Dense layer.

Trained using Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss.

Evaluated performance on unseen data.

Plotted training/validation loss and saved the model.

Challenges Faced:
Creating the right window size for sequences was critical.

LSTM models are sensitive to the shape of input.

Required feature engineering and careful normalization for stability.
