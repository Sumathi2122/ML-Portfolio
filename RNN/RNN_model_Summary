Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)
Dataset Used: IMDB Movie Review Dataset (binary classification)

Task: Sentiment analysis of movie reviews

Tools: TensorFlow/Keras, pad_sequences

What We Did:
Explored and decoded tokenized reviews using IMDb's word index.

Applied padding to handle variable-length sequences.

Built an RNN model:

Embedding layer to learn word representations.

SimpleRNN with dropout and recurrent dropout for regularization.

Sigmoid activation in output layer for binary prediction.

Trained using binary_crossentropy loss, evaluated with accuracy.

Generated classification report with precision, recall, F1-score.

Visualized model learning curves and saved trained model.

Challenges Faced:
RNNs are known to suffer from vanishing gradient issues.

They do not perform well with long-range dependencies.

Training was slow, and performance wasnâ€™t optimal compared to LSTM/Transformer.
